The tip given by ODIN PROJECT is 

### "Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!"


## Logic Thinking

Rock = 1
Paper = 2
Scissors = 3

Winner = [[1,3],[2,1],[3,2]]

When user press the button,
1. Generates a random number
2. Converts value of buttons to an interger
3. Check if it's a winning combination
