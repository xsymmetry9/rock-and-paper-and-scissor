Goal: Practice toggling the element via display= none and display =block/flex

1. Changed the order of the layout.
    - Scoreboard is at the top with "Title-box" and is hidden.
2. Added a display property "hidden" for scoreboard, replay on CSS
3. Added a start button which changes the "title-box" display property to "none" and changes "scoreBoard" diplay to flex.
4. Added more button properties - when hovering the button, it expands a scale of 1.1 larger and changes the opacity to .1 less.
5. Added a replay button.  


The tip given by ODIN PROJECT is
